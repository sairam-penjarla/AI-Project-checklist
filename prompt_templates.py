    ## Project Overview
    
    In today's fast-paced world, creating effective presentations quickly is crucial. Our AI-powered presentation generator is designed to make this process easier, faster, and more efficient. This project allows users to create customized presentations by specifying simple details such as the number of slides, the content they want, and the design preferences. 
    
    ### Key Features:
    - **AI-Driven Slide Generation:** Based on user input, the AI generates slides with relevant content and design.
    - **Downloadable Slides:** Users can download individual slides, each designed according to their specifications.
    - **Session Storage:** Previous sessions are stored and can be accessed in the sidebar, allowing users to revisit or modify their presentations.
    - **Logging System:** A detailed log of the user's activities is maintained in an `app.log` file, ensuring transparency and easy debugging.
    - **Custom Template Support:** Users can add new templates by creating a PowerPoint (PPT) file with placeholders like `slide_title`, `heading1`, and others, which the AI will map to content.
    - **Technologies Used:** The project leverages OpenAI for AI generation, Flask for the backend, and SQLite for session storage. Frontend technologies include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user interaction.
    
    ## YouTube Video
    
    For those who are new to this project or need a visual walkthrough, we have prepared a detailed YouTube video that walks through the entire setup and usage process. This video guides users through each step to ensure they can easily create and manage presentations using the AI system.

### Task

You are a content writer who is tasked with writing a blog article for a project using the below given guidelines. the blog should have the below indicated sections.

### Sections

Architecture Diagram, Tools Used, Workflow

### Guidelines

Begin each sub-section with a clear header using markdown syntax (i.e., `##` for major sections and `###` for sub-sections). This will make the content easy to navigate and understand.

1. **Architecture Diagram:**
    - Provide a visual representation of the system architecture, using an image placeholder where the architecture diagram will go.
    - Clearly describe the relationships between key components, such as how user input interacts with the AI backend and the database.
    - Make sure to update the `path/to/architecture_diagram.png` with the actual path or URL of the diagram once it is available.
2. **Tools Used:**
    - List and briefly describe the tools, technologies, and frameworks used in the project.
3. **Workflow:**
    - Outline the steps in the process of using the application, from user input to slide download.
    - Use numbered points for a clear step-by-step breakdown of the workflow.
    - Keep the steps concise but detailed enough to help the reader understand how the system works.
4. Example:
    
    ```markdown
    
    ## Architecture Diagram
    
    ![Architecture Diagram](path/to/architecture_diagram.png)
    
    In this project, the architecture revolves around the interaction between the front-end interface, the AI backend, and the database. Users interact with the front-end, where they specify the number of slides, content details, and design preferences. This input is then sent to the AI backend, powered by OpenAI, which generates the requested slides based on the user's specifications. The backend communicates with an SQLite database to store user data, past sessions, and logs. Users can access these past sessions through a sidebar and download individual slides with specific designs.
    
    ## Tools Used
    
    ### 1. OpenAI
    OpenAI's GPT-3 API is used to generate slide content based on user input. The AI processes the specified content and design details to create slides that match the user's requirements.
    
    ### 2. Flask
    Flask is a lightweight Python web framework used to build the backend of the application. It handles requests from the user, processes the input, and sends it to OpenAI for slide generation. Flask also serves the front-end and manages session data.
    
    ### 3. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
    These front-end technologies are used to build the user interface. HTML provides the structure of the web pages, CSS is used for styling, and JavaScript enables dynamic behavior, such as interacting with the backend and updating the interface in real time.
    
    ### 4. SQLite
    SQLite is used to store user data, past sessions, and logs. It ensures that users can refer back to previous sessions and access logs for troubleshooting or reference.
    
    ### 5. `.env` File
    The `.env` file is used to store sensitive information, such as the OpenAI API token, which is required to interact with OpenAI‚Äôs services securely.
    
    ## Workflow
    
    1. **User Input**: The user specifies the number of slides, the content to be included, and the desired design.
    2. **Backend Processing**: The input is sent to the Flask backend, which processes the data and sends it to OpenAI‚Äôs API for slide generation.
    3. **Slide Generation**: OpenAI generates slides based on the user‚Äôs input, including design elements and textual content.
    4. **Database Interaction**: The generated slides, along with session details, are saved in an SQLite database for future reference.
    5. **Past Sessions**: The user can view past sessions through a sidebar and select any previous slide deck for reference.
    6. **Slide Download**: The user can download individual slides with the specified design, either as images or in a PPT format.
    7. **Logging**: All actions, including slide generation and user interactions, are logged in an `app.log` file for debugging and monitoring purposes.
    ```

Project Installation and Execution Guide

### **Guidelines**

Provide detailed instructions for setting up the project, formatted with proper markdown code blocks and links.

- Instructions for cloning the repository using the `git clone` command.
- Instructions for navigating to the cloned directory using `cd`.
- A link to your blog post where users can learn how to create a virtual environment (or Anaconda environment): [Learn VirtualEnv Basics](https://psairam9301.wixsite.com/website/post/learn-virtualenv-basics).
- Instructions for creating a virtual environment or an Anaconda environment.
- Instructions for installing dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file.
- Steps for running the project using Python.
- Example format:
    
    ```markdown
    
    # Project Installation and Execution Guide
    
    Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:
    
    ### 1. Clone the Repository
    
    To begin, clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:
    
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
    
    Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of the repository.
    
    ### 2. Navigate to the Cloned Directory
    
    Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project directory by running:
    
    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>
    ```
    
    Replace `<project_directory>` with the name of the directory created after cloning.
    
    ### 3. Create a Virtual Environment
    
    It is recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. You can create a virtual environment by following this guide:  
    [Learn VirtualEnv Basics](https://psairam9301.wixsite.com/website/post/learn-virtualenv-basics).
    
    Alternatively, if you prefer using Anaconda, you can create an Anaconda environment by running the following command:
    
    ```bash
    conda create --name <env_name> python=3.x
    ```
    
    Replace `<env_name>` with the name you wish to give your environment, and `3.x` with the version of Python required for the project.
    
    Activate the environment with:
    
    ```bash
    conda activate <env_name>
    ```
    
    ### 4. Install Dependencies
    
    The project uses a `requirements.txt` file to manage dependencies. Install the required libraries by running:
    
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
    This will ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed for the project to function properly.
    
    ### 5. Configure the `.env` File
    
    The project requires an API token from OpenAI to work. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your `OPENAI_API_TOKEN` as follows:
    
    ```
    OPENAI_API_TOKEN=<your_openai_api_token>
    ```
    
    Make sure to replace `<your_openai_api_token>` with your actual token from OpenAI.
    
    ### 6. Run the Project
    
    Finally, to run the project, execute the following command:
    
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    
    This will start the Flask server and the application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.
    ```
