Automated Email Response Recommendation System
This project is an AI-driven automated email response recommendation system. The main goal is to assist customer service teams by recommending the most appropriate email response based on the content of incoming customer emails. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) to analyze email content and suggests responses that are both relevant and personalized. The system also tracks previous recommendations, learning from past interactions to improve future suggestions. The project integrates with popular email platforms like Gmail and Outlook, making it easy for customer service representatives to access and use the recommendations. Additionally, the system is designed to integrate with customer support ticketing systems, enabling automatic logging of responses.

```json
{
    "diagram": "automated_email_response_architecture.png",
    "description": "The architecture diagram for the Automated Email Response Recommendation System illustrates the flow of data and interactions between the user interface, backend services, AI model, and email platforms. The process begins when an email is received by the email client, which triggers the system to analyze the content of the email using NLP. The system processes the email's subject and body to identify the user's intent and sentiment. It then queries the database of pre-written responses, using machine learning algorithms to rank and recommend the most relevant ones. The selected response is displayed to the customer service representative, who can approve it, modify it, or send it as is. If the response is sent, the system logs the interaction for future learning. The architecture also includes integrations with email platforms and ticketing systems. Major components include email parsing, NLP processing, response ranking, database management, and logging. Key services and tools used in the project include Python, Flask, TensorFlow for NLP, PostgreSQL for the database, and third-party email and ticketing system APIs."

## Architecture Diagram

### Automated Email Response Recommendation System Architecture

The following architecture diagram provides an in-depth look at the components and workflow of the **Automated Email Response Recommendation System**. The system uses multiple technologies and services to automatically analyze incoming emails and recommend appropriate responses for customer service teams.

![Architecture Diagram](media/automated_email_response_architecture.png)

### Detailed Description of the Architecture

#### 1. **Email Platform Integration**
   - The process begins when an email is received by an integrated **email client** (such as Gmail or Outlook). The system automatically detects incoming emails via **IMAP/SMTP protocols**.
   - **Email Parsing**: The email content, including the subject and body, is parsed to extract key data, such as the sender, subject line, and message body. This data is then sent to the backend for processing.

#### 2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
   - The parsed email content is sent to an **NLP model** (powered by **TensorFlow** or **spaCy**) that performs sentiment analysis, intent detection, and entity extraction. This helps understand the customer's needs and the tone of the email.
   - **Intent Detection**: The system identifies the main request or question in the email (e.g., refund request, product inquiry).
   - **Sentiment Analysis**: The model analyzes the emotional tone of the email (positive, negative, neutral), which is used to tailor the response appropriately.

#### 3. **Response Ranking and Recommendation**
   - After processing the email with NLP, the system queries a **database** of pre-written responses, which are stored in **PostgreSQL** or a NoSQL database like **MongoDB**. These responses are categorized by topics and are ranked based on their relevance to the parsed email content.
   - **Machine Learning Model**: The system uses a **ranking algorithm**, such as a decision tree or deep learning model, to select the most relevant responses based on previous interactions and the current email's context.
   - The ranking process ensures that the system suggests responses that are not only accurate but also personalized, improving the overall customer experience.

#### 4. **Display and User Interaction**
   - The ranked response options are displayed to the **customer service representative** through the user interface, developed using **Flask** for the web framework. The representative can either approve a recommended response, modify it, or write a custom response.
   - **Email Customization**: The system allows the representative to adjust the tone and details of the response, providing flexibility while ensuring consistency in communication.

#### 5. **Response Sentiment and Feedback Loop**
   - Once the response is selected and sent to the customer, the system logs the interaction in the **database** for future learning. This feedback loop helps the system improve over time by refining the response recommendations based on past performance.
   - **Logging**: All interactions, including the email content, recommended responses, and customer feedback, are stored in the database for future analysis and model training.

#### 6. **Ticketing System Integration**
   - The system is also integrated with **customer support ticketing systems** like **Zendesk** or **Freshdesk**. Once the email response is sent, a corresponding support ticket is created or updated, allowing customer service representatives to track the progress of customer issues.
   - This integration ensures that responses are logged in the system and that the workflow remains seamless for customer support teams.

#### 7. **Key Components and Services**
   - **NLP Processing**: Powered by **TensorFlow** or **spaCy** for intent recognition, sentiment analysis, and entity extraction.
   - **Email Platform APIs**: Integration with Gmail, Outlook, or other email clients via **IMAP/SMTP**.
   - **Database Management**: **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB** is used for storing pre-written responses, logs, and interaction history.
   - **Flask Web Application**: The front-end interface for customer service representatives to interact with the system.
   - **Machine Learning Models**: Ranking models such as decision trees, SVM, or neural networks are used to select the best response.

#### 8. **Key Flask Routes**
   - **`/get_email_data`**: Retrieves the email content to be analyzed by the NLP model.
   - **`/process_email`**: Processes the email using NLP and machine learning models to detect intent and rank possible responses.
   - **`/get_recommended_responses`**: Fetches the top-ranked email responses from the database.
   - **`/send_response`**: Sends the selected response to the customer through the email client.
   - **`/log_interaction`**: Logs the customer interaction for future learning and feedback.
   - **`/integrate_ticketing_system`**: Updates the customer support ticket with the interaction details.

By utilizing a combination of **email parsing**, **NLP**, **machine learning**, and **integration with email and ticketing platforms**, the system offers a streamlined and intelligent approach to customer support. It not only assists in responding to emails faster but also ensures that the responses are relevant, personalized, and efficient.
